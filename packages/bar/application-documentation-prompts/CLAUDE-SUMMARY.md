# Generating Summary Content

This prompt defines how to generate the `summary.md` file. The Summary is the first link in the VibeLens and serves as a high-level, non-technical overview of the application for a general audience.

---

## Purpose

The Summary document answers: **"What did I build?"** It's written for anyone — including you, the person who built the app. No code, no jargon, just a clear explanation of what the app does and why it matters.

## CRITICAL: Privacy & Security

**DO NOT** read, reference, or include content from `.env` files, credentials, API keys, secrets, PII, PHI, database dumps with real user data, or any file that could compromise security or privacy. If you encounter sensitive data, skip it entirely. Reference environment variables by name only (e.g., "requires `DATABASE_URL`") without revealing values.

## Target File

```
summary.md
```

## Structure

Generate the markdown file with exactly these sections, in this order:

### Version Stamp (required first line)

The very first line of the generated file **must** be the following HTML comment. The VibeLens component checks for this stamp and will prompt the user to regenerate if it is missing or outdated.

```markdown
<!-- vibelens format:1 -->
```

This line must appear before anything else — before the title, before any blank lines.

### 1. Title

A single `#` heading with the app name.

```markdown
<!-- vibelens format:1 -->
# [App Name]
```

### 2. One-Line Description

A single sentence immediately below the title that captures the app's purpose in plain language. Maximum 20 words. No jargon.

```markdown
A [what it is] that [what it does] for [who it serves].
```

### 3. Overview

A 2–3 paragraph section under `## Overview` explaining:

- What problem the app solves
- Who the intended users are
- What the core user experience looks like (from the user's perspective, not yours as the builder)
- What makes this app interesting or different from alternatives

**Tone:** Conversational, clear, confident. Write as if explaining the app to a smart friend who is not a developer. Avoid hedging language ("kind of", "sort of", "basically").

### 4. Key Features

A section under `## Key Features` with 4–6 features, each as a subheading (`###`) with a 1–2 sentence description.

**Rules:**

- Feature names should be user-facing capabilities, not technical components
- Describe what the user experiences, not how it's built
- Each feature description must be self-contained — no forward references
- No bullet lists inside features — use prose

**Good:** `### Instant Search` — "Find any document across your entire workspace in milliseconds. Results update as you type with highlighted matches."

**Bad:** `### ElasticSearch Integration` — "Uses ElasticSearch with BM25 ranking to query the documents index."

### 5. How It Works

A section under `## How It Works` with 3–5 numbered steps describing the user flow from start to finish. Each step is a `###` subheading with a short description.

```markdown
## How It Works

### 1. [Action the user takes]
[1–2 sentences describing this step from the user's perspective]

### 2. [Next action]
[1–2 sentences]
```

**Rules:**

- Steps describe the user's journey, not the system architecture
- Use active voice: "You upload...", "The app processes...", "You review..."
- Keep it to the happy path — no error handling, edge cases, or branching
- Maximum 5 steps — if the flow is longer, combine steps

### 6. Use Cases

A section under `## Use Cases` with 3–4 concrete scenarios. Each is a `###` subheading with a 2–3 sentence narrative.

```markdown
## Use Cases

### Teams Managing Shared Documents
Your team collaborates on hundreds of documents and needs a single place to search, organize, and review them. Upload your files and get an instant searchable archive with version history.
```

**Rules:**

- Each use case tells a mini-story: who, situation, how the app helps
- Use second person ("You're...") or third person ("A developer needs...")
- Concrete and specific — avoid generic "useful for teams" language
- Distinct scenarios — don't repeat the same use case in different words

### 7. Tech Stack (Brief)

A section under `## Built With` listing the major technologies as a simple, readable paragraph — not a bullet list. One sentence. Name 3–5 core technologies.

```markdown
## Built With

Built with React and Express on Node.js, backed by PostgreSQL, with Claude powering the AI features.
```

**Rules:**

- One sentence, plain language
- Name the framework/tool, not the version
- No links in this section
- No explanations of what each tool does — just the names

---

## Content Rules

1. **Length:** 400–600 words total (excluding headings)
2. **Markdown only:** No HTML, no JSX, no frontmatter
3. **No code blocks** of actual application code — this is a summary, not documentation
4. **No architecture details** — save those for Technical Summary and Technical Overview
5. **No links to external resources** — keep the document self-contained
6. **No images** unless the consuming app provides them in a known location
7. **Headings hierarchy:** `#` for title, `##` for sections, `###` for sub-items
8. **No horizontal rules** (`---`) between sections — headings provide enough separation
9. **Tone:** Professional but approachable. Informative without being dry. Enthusiastic without being salesy.

## Generating for a New Project

1. Read the project's source code and configuration files to understand what it does
2. Identify the user-facing features (not the technical implementation)
3. Map out the user flow from first interaction to final result
4. Write the summary following the structure above
5. Verify: could you read this and understand your own app? If not, simplify.
6. Verify: does every section exist and follow the rules? Check length is 400–600 words.
